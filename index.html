      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dIpJ6p7.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I have graduated from Half Hollow Hills High School East in 2014, and am expecting a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science from Stony Brook University, and because I am close to obtaining said degree, I am looking for a part time position to efficiently fill my hours while studying on the side. 
        My freshman year summer internship I had landed was actually a Fraud Analyst position at AFCC a security sub division of EMC 
        (The nationâ€™s largest database company) and continued to work there for over a year. I also have skills, and experiences such 
        as being proficient with software packages such as Microsoft Office, Adobe, iMovie, Audacity, Windows Movie Maker, Wordpress etc.
         and being able to learn software and code in short periods of time, if need be. Also experience in some graphic design.</p>

      <p>Not only that,
        but my previous work experience listed in my resume have allowed me to develop my now excellent negotiation and persuasion skills, 
        excellent written and verbal communication and interpersonal skills, great ability to develop and maintain effective relationships 
        and customer satisfaction. Maintaining myself in an organized and structured fashion while also completing tasks and communicating 
        effectively among various parties and representing the company in a courteous and professional manner is second nature to me. </p>

      <p>Also as of recent I have been enrolled in a Full Stack Developer Program at Columbia University at the Fu Foundation School
        of Engineering and Applied Science which means though I will have some familiarity coming into the program with the course
         material, I will eventually be graduating from it with full stack web development skills such as data structures, algorithms,
          Html, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Heroku, Git, MySQL, MongoDB, Nodejs and more. I will deeply consider 
          any position that might be open to me. I wish to expand my horizon with your company and not only that but I believe those 
          qualities shall contribute quite a bit to the success of your company, myself, and my co-workers.</p>
